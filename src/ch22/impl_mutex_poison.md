# Poisoning

 The issue is what happens if the user code panics while its making changes to the inner data it can result in the data being left in an incoherent state.
We can implement mechanisms in order to alert the user if this happens. At the moment whether to include this aspect is included in the std library, at the time of writing this, is under debate. TODO check


## Problem and Solution


## Implementation
